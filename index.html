	<h2>Hobbies</h2>
	<p>I like to draw, paint, fence, and play ukelele. I just got a guitar so I would like to learn to play that.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>My goal is to learn to play the guitar, and become fluent in another language besides spanish and english. I would like to play guitar because music plays a very big roal in my life. Whenever I find myself in a situation where I am stressed out or sad I can always listen to my music, or play my instruments to make me feel better.</p>
